## What data was used?

The data in this collection was manually pulled from a the fragrance house's website, Parfumo/Basenotes, and Fragrantica. Certain notes used by the perfumer (especially adjective - note) have been tagged twice to improve fragrance searchability. The name used by the fragrance house on their website was prioritized when discrepancies between names on the fragrance house's website and the databases emerged, with some liberties being taken for clarity. Images are borrowed from the fragrance house's website whenever possible, with alternatives from Parfumo or Fragrantica being used when no stable image link was available. When multiple release years were noted without the fragrance house offering this information, the latter year was used.
